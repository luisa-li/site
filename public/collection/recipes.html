            <p> i'm a huge fan of asian cuisine, and meals that take little prep and little cleanup. here is a collection of my favorite recipes for my own reference, and for anyone trying to get into quick and delicious asian food! </p>
            <p> <b> vibe recipes </b> </p>
            <ul>
                <li> fried rice, needs no explanation, a staple of chinese (and peruvian!) cuisine. </li>
                <li> tomato egg, make scrambled eggs (keep pieces large), fry tomatoes, combine. season and serve with rice. </li>
                <li> bibimbap, matchstick carrots and cucumber and slice onion, and can add any other quick veggies like spinach or lettuce, cook with a bit of salt and oil, serve with a bowl of rice, two fried eggs for protein and of course gochujang. </li>
                <li> japanese curry, the standard potato, carrot, onion plus golden curry cubes, cooking sped up by microwaving the root veggies before throwing it in a pan, and served over rice with any protein. </li>
                <li> instant ramen, pimped up with chilli oil, a soy marinated egg and a couple quick veggies. </li>
                <li> rice cooker meals, throw in rice, a couple lap cheong (cantonese style sausages), corn, carrots or peeled potato cubes to cook with the rice, season with a standard mix of soy sauce, sweetener and sesame oil. </li>
                <li> pan fried trader joes dumplings, a liberal amount of oil on a pan, crisp up the bottom of the dumplings, add water to steam until water evaporates and dumpling bottoms become crispy again, serve with soy sauce and chilli oil. </li>
                <li> many types of pasta dishes, huge fan of funky shaped pasta, tossed in a creamy tomato sauce and plenty of onion and pepper.</li>
                <li> miso egg drop soup with soft tofu, comforting and homey, a favorite of me and my roommate after a long day at work.</li>
                <li> garlic green beans, green beans pan fried on low heat, lots of garlic, toss with a little bit of soy sauce and salt to taste.</li>
                <li> baked veggies! broccoli, carrots, cauliflower, potatoes, baked and served along with rice or any leftover protein.</li>
                <li> corn on the cob, buttered. </li>
                <p class="whisper"> y'all are afraid to be corny, but i was born on the cob </p>
