            <p> hi there! i'm luisa, but you knew that already. </p>
            <p> a couple quick facts: raised in peru, favorite color green, currently playing tears of the kingdom, really into slab climbs and minecraft let's plays, #1 book is the three body problem, followed by freedom by jonathan franzen, i own a pi creature from 3b1b named pretzel, i crochet and knit (but better at crochet), and i'm pretty decent at chess. </p>
            <p> i study cs & math, and am quite equally liking both. research wise, i'm broadly into the field of machine learning, both theory and application, and am specifically intrigued by the interpretable kind of models built on inductive bias, informed by domain knowledge of the problem at hand. </p>
            <p> and that's me. toss me a fun fact, and i'll throw one your way too. </p>

            <p class="glossary"> here, a fun fact: there is a village in puno, peru where the urus people live on floating structures made of a straw-like plant on lake titicaca, moving every decade or so after constructing new islands. you can also eat the plant they use to build - it's crunchy and a bit sweet, kind of like munching on a sugar cane. see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Titicaca#Uros"> the wikipedia page on lake titicaca. </a> </p>
