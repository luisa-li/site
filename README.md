A WIP of a personal website I'm building to host an online version of my resume, and collect bits and bobs of my thoughts and the cool things I learn.

The site can be found here: https://luisa-li.github.io/site/

Fun fact! My given name is Tao (éŸ¬), which sounds similar to the Greek symbol Tau, hence the icon of the website!
