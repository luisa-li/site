            <p id="intro">why write "a page intentionally left blank" on a page, if the act of writing it makes it not blank? </p>
        </div>
        <div class="body">

            <p> growing up studying in a IGCSE and later IB school, there were big important exams at the end of virtually every school year. these were no ordinary exams, the papers came neatly packaged in a sealed cardboard box opened only on the day of the exam, and were sent back immediately after to the Uk where they would be graded by teaching professionals looking to make some extra bucks (or quids, i guess). </p>

            <p>anyway, the point is, the exam papers were pristinely formatted everytime with the crispiness of newly printed paper, and many a times i've encountered a blank page with <i> This page intentionally left blank. </i> printed on. this has always felt ironic, doesn't the act of printing on it makes it no longer blank? </p>

            <p> the question of its purpose lingered without answer for years, hence this little post looking into it. </p>
