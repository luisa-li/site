            <p> i read prolifically when i travel. i went to many gorgous places this year and read many brilliant books that left me sitting in existential silence on cars, planes and trains. </p>

            <p> without further rationale, here is my reading itinerary for the first half of 2024, and a brief sometimes not so brief review of each of the books and where i read them. this blog is brought to you by the obb and sbb, written by luisa while travelling across austria and switzerland. </p>

            <p class="whisper"> book review is a serious thing. so we're Turning On The Proper Capitalizations. </p>

            <p class="whisper"> needless to say, spoilers ahead! </p>

            <h3> Hunger Games Trilogy: Hunger Games, Catching Fire, and Mockingjay by Suzanne Collins </h3>

            <p> I loved the trilogy. I watched "The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes" before reading these books, got tons of Hunger Games content put on my TikTok feed, and falsely believed that Peeta dies at the end. A dear friend of mine, Sofia, kept up with that lie throughout the four months I was reading this trilogy, and it was only on the last page that I realized that I was lied to. </p>

            <p> Novels primarily read by teenagers or young adults always get a bad rep, as if being liked by that demographic nullifies its value as good literature. The Hunger Games trilogy is usually grouped together with other dystopian young adult series like Divergent or Maze Runner, but it's better, and in my opinion it comes down to world building. </p>

            <p> Unlike Divergent and Maze Runner, where development of the plot relied on one novel revelation after another, almost like a picture that keeps being expanded at its edges, with new content being drawn in with each successive expansion, conflict arise naturally from the world that has been established. Katniss is chosen as the tribute in the first book, and we follow her and Peeta through to their win, witnessing the fall of characters both likeable and unlikeable but equally sympathizable. Her defiant action with the berries during her first hunger games unknowingly spark a fire of revolution in a poverty-stricken and opressed Panam, with her as the unwilling mockingjay to the revolution. The whole picture of Panam is laid out at once, and the plot develops from the structure of that world, and not from, for example, Tris's mother suddenly being a divergent herself or Thomas actually being part of the organization that created maze. </p>

            <p> Another hightlight of hunger games is arguably the character construction. I am a huge fan of unlikeable, and flawed protagonists, as you might be able to tell from my love of Franzen's "Freedom", and Katniss is undoubtedly an unlikeable character. She's selfish, cold, undecisive, and impressively short sighted for a protagonist of a dystopian novel. It makes the world through her lens that much more interesting to follow. The good characters don't end with her, I loved Finnick, Haymitch, Effie, Cinna, Rue, and maybe even Gale. </p>

            <p> Because Katniss is so myopic, every event is unexpected and out of her control. Katniss is thrown into a stream of events she has no control over - she does not want to be the tribute for district 13, to act out the love story with Peeta, to be the spark to that evolution, to become the symbol of that revolution. I loved the flow of events in this way, and it really reminded me of this quote from "Purity": </p>

            <p id="intro"> You could cooperate with the system or you could oppose it, but the one thing you could never do, whether you were enjoying a secure and pleasant life or sitting in a prison, was not be in relation to it. </p>

            <p> Anyway, this was a particularly long ramble. TLDR: Loved the books, no major complaint. Beautifully constructed dystopia allegorical to world events today, can't wait to read about Haymitch's games. </p>
