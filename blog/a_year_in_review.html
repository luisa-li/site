            <p class="whisper"> clearly a thing that i have not learned this year is actual web development, since this website is still made entirely of straight html and css >:D </p>

            <p class="whisper"> long blog ahead, but it's been a long year </p>

            <h3> part I: jan - jun, the big girl employment </h3>
        
            <p> i worked full time at a pharmaceutical company called montai health for the first half of the year, working on machine learning and engineering problems in the context of drug discovery. i learned a whole lot along the way, and here's an executive summary slash reflection, minus the nda bits.  a huge shoutout to all the amazing peeps on the computational modeling team, it was an amazing experience working as part of the team. <span class="pink-highlight"> <3 </span> </p>

            <p> </p>

            <h3> part III: sep - dec, the fall semester </h3>

            <p> fall was a good and busy time. unlike fall of 23, where i was swamped beyond belief with coursework, squeezing in social time in between the crevices of time blocked out for academic work in my google calendar, time of this fall was quite evenly distributed between my many commitments. i wrote down a few semesterly goals in august, and here's a few that i've achieved for the class, in no particular order: </p>

            <ul>
                <li> i upped my climbing game! after a year of carefully treading into the sport again post injury, i think i'm once again climbing at peak strength and technique. i began sending v3s consistently a month or so ago, and am steadily sending v4s and projecting v5s in the last few weeks. hoping to stay strong and healthy in 2025 so i can keep sending sketchy slabs. </li>
                <li> i made up my mind about what i want professionally, and pivoted to that direction. i've always felt decisions like these are particularly hard to make, because remaining still is just so comfortable, so i'm proud to have made the pivot. </li>
                <li> i ran my first 5k again, after not running consistently in two years, and i ran it at a 6min/km pace, way faster than i've ever managed to run distance before. and maybe this is the first sign of me approaching my quarter life crisis, but i think i'll sign up for a 10k next year. :D </li>
                <li> i made new friends! and i socialized! and i went out! i've prioritized good people over work this semester, and importantly, made it to every plan i promised, even if it meant scrambling until late night to finish work. </li>
                <li> i did purposeful academic work. in the past, i've always been driven to achieve high scores for the sake of perfectionism rather than learning, and often being short on time this semester taught me to prioritize understanding over numerical scores. as such, i spent my time on reading textbooks and understanding material, rather than polishing my assignments over and over for an extra .5 on my grade. not the most exciting accomplishment, but i am proud of that shift in mentality.  </li>
                
            </ul>

            <p> i also, obviously, took classes. here are my favorite bits from each. </p>

            <h4> math3545: graph theory </h4>

            <p class="whisper"> hexagons are the bestagons! </p>

            <p> proving that a plane can only be tiled with three types of regular polygons (triangles, squares and hexagons) through euler's formula, the handshake lemma and the faceshake lemma, all of which are elementary results of studying planar graphs. </p>

            <p> euler's formula states that for a planar graph: </p>
            <p> \[ e + 2 = n + f\]</p>
            <p> where \(G = (V, E)\), \( e = |E| \), \( n = |V| \), and \(f\) is the number of faces the planar graph \(G\). </p>

            <p> the handshake lemma states that the sum of node degrees in a graph is equal to double the number of edges, which is an intuitive result: </p>

            <p> \[ \sum_{v \in V} deg(v) = 2e \]</p>

            <p> and lastly, the faceshake lemma (as dubbed by my professor) is the equivalent of the handshake lemma for the faces in a planar graph, stating that the sum of face degrees (or the number of edges that make up a face) is equivalent also to double the number of edges. also quite intuitive: </p>

            <p> \[ \sum_{f \in F} deg(f) = 2e \]</p>

            <p> the handshake and faceshake lemma are simplified to \( nk = 2e \) and \( fl = 2e \), respectively, with the original assumptions that we are tiling with regular polygons. \( k \) is the degree of each node, and \(l\) is the number of sides of the polygon that we wish to tile with. </p>

            <p> it turns out that that is enough for us to concretely say something about the polygons we can use to tile a 2D plane with. with some algebraic manipulations and number theory, we find eventually that the only integer \(k\) and \(l\) that satisfy constraints are \(k = 6, l = 3\), \(k = 4, l = 4\), \(k = 3, l = 6\), which corresponds to triangles, squares and hexagons, respectively. </p>

            <p class="whisper"> isn't it pretty cool that elementary results in graph theory can tell you something so general about regular tilings? :D </p>

            <h4>  cs3800: theory of computation </h4>

            <p> proving that the traveling salesperson problem (TSP) is NP complete. </p>

            <p> back in highschool i did a long project on various exploration and exploitation strategies in genetic algorithms evaluated on the traveling salesperson problem, and i distinctly remember writing in my final paper that TSP is NP-complete, without really understanding what it meant. it genuinely felt like a full circle moment when learned about complexity classes in our final lectures. the actual proof, which involved a polynomial time mapping reduction from the hamiltonian cycle problem, was not exactly exciting, but finally acquiring enough background to fully understand something previously out of reach was satisfying. </p>

            <p> i also saw a bunch of very interesting, creative and sometimes unintuitive proofs in this class. notably, the proof that language \(L\) is regular iff \(\exists\) a regular expression \(R\) s.t \(L(R) = L\), and the reduction from 3SAT to the subset sum problem. </p>
