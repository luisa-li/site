            <p class="whisper"> clearly a thing that i have not learned this year is actual web development, since this website is still made entirely of straight html and css >:D </p>

            <h3> part I: jan - jun, the big girl employment </h3>
        
            <p> i worked full time at a pharmaceutical company called montai health for the first half of the year, working on machine learning and engineering problems in the context of drug discovery. i learned a whole lot along the way, and here's an executive summary slash reflection, minus the nda bits.  a huge shoutout to all the amazing peeps on the computational modeling team, it was an amazing experience working as part of the team. <span class="pink-highlight"> <3 </span> </p>

            <h3> part III: sep - dec, the fall semester </h3>

            <p> fall was a good and busy time. unlike fall of 23, where i was swamped beyond belief with coursework, squeezing in social time in between the crevices of time blocked out for academic work in my google calendar, time of this fall was quite evenly distributed between my many commitments. i wrote down a few semesterly goals in august, and here's a few that i've achieved for the class, in no particular order: </p>

            <ul>
                <li> i upped my climbing game! after a year of carefully treading into the sport again post injury, i think i'm once again climbing at peak strength and technique. i began sending v3s consistently a month or so ago, and am steadily sending v4s and projecting v5s in the last few weeks. given proximity of the new job to the gym, there will of course be more to me.</li>
                <li> i made up my mind about what i want professionally, and pivoted to that direction. i've always felt decisions like these are particularly hard to make, because staying in comfort is just so comfortable, so i'm proud to have done it. </li>
                <li> i ran my first 5k again, after not running consistently in two years, and i ran it at a 6min/km pace, way faster than i've ever managed to run distance before. and maybe this is the first sign of me approaching my quarter life crisis, but i think i'll sign up for a 10k next year. :D </li>
                <li> i made new friends! and i socialized! and i went out! i've prioritized good people over work this semester, and importantly, made it to every plan i promised, even if it meant scrambling until late night to finish work. </li>
                <li> i did purposeful academic work. in the past, i've always been driven to achieve high scores for the sake of perfectionism rather than learning, and often being short on time this semester taught me to prioritize understanding over numerical scores. as such, i spent my time on reading textbooks and understanding material, rather than polishing my assignments over and over for an extra .5 on my grade. not the most exciting accomplishment, but i am proud of that shift in mentality.  </li>
                
            </ul>

        <p> i also, obviously, took classes. here are my favorite bits from each: <p>
