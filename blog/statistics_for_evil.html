            <p id="intro"> did you know that hong kong's higher life expectancy relative to india is directly related to their meat consumption? </p>
        </div>
        <div class="body">

            <p> of course you didn't! someone on the internet made up that correlation. </p>

            <p> actually! it is not even a correlation! mathematically you can draw a line through any two points, i could be plotting the number of birkenstock sales in the united states and the ocurrence of foot fungus per 1000 people, and those two dots would still make a line. </p>

            <p class="whisper"> the original statistic on meat consumption and life expectancy was actually part of a post influencing people to a carnivorous diet. apparently veganism is no longer the hip and healthy thing to do, because eating raw sticks of butter and consuming unpasteurized dairy is the trend now. i actually have too many opinions about this, but i won't babble on. </p>

            <p> anyway! here's some made up facts, collected from doomscrolling on reels. </p>

            <h3> </h3>

            <h3> the average american made $106,400 in 2022 </h3>

            <p> the average income per house hold in the united states in 2022 was $106,400, according to <a href="https://www.census.gov/data/tables/2023/demo/income-poverty/p60-279.html">table A2</a> on income in the united states, made by the united states census bureau. this is correct but misleading - the fact that the average is 106,400 does not mean that the average joe is making 106,400. </p>
            
            <p> data distribution matters. especially when 1% of the population holds <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/z1/dataviz/dfa/distribute/table/#quarter:129;series:Net%20worth;demographic:networth;population:all;units:shares">30.4% of the country's wealth</a> as of Q1 2024. here, a different measure of central tendency, the median, is much more appropriate, and that number is $74,580. </p>
            
            <p> measures of dispersion would give nice insight, but if your attention span can only capture one number at a time, let it be the median. </p>
