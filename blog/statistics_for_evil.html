            <p id="intro"> did you know that hong kong's higher life expectancy relative to india is directly related to their meat consumption? </p>

        <div class="body">

            <p> <span class="yellow-highlight">of course you didn't!</span> someone on the internet made up that correlation. </p>

            <p> actually! it is not even a correlation! mathematically you can draw a line through any two points, i could be plotting the number of birkenstock sales in the united states and the ocurrence of foot fungus per 1000 people, and those two dots would still make a line. </p>

            <p class="whisper"> the original statistic on meat consumption and life expectancy was actually part of a post influencing people to a carnivorous diet. apparently veganism is no longer the hip and healthy thing to do, because eating raw sticks of butter and consuming unpasteurized dairy is the trend now. i actually have too many opinions about this, but i won't babble. </p>
